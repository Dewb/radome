radome
======

Radome is a platform for realtime interactive animation on a dome. It manages both 2D and 3D content
for projection onto a fulldome installation with multiple projectors.

This is a early-stage prototype.  Windows support is planned but right now the build tree is Mac only.

Radome is built with openFrameworks 0073.  The following addons are required:
* ofxCubeMap
* ofxASSimpModelLoader
* ofxUI
* ofxXMLSettings
* ofxSyphon

These dependencies will probably be incorporated into this repo in the near future, but for now you'll
need to install them in the openFramework addons folder yourself.
